# TypeScript Express Template

## Purpose

A basic initial setup of Express with TypeScript and a logger.

## How to Use

- clone/fork repo

- run `yarn` to install

- copy `.env.example` to `.env`

- run `yarn dev` or `yarn start` to get started

## Production

production currently uses `pm2` for this template, which is not installed in
this package, because it should be installed globally.
