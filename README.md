# TypeScript Node Template

## Purpose

A basic initial setup of Node with TypeScript with a logger.

## How to Use

- clone/fork repo

- run `yarn` to install

- run `yarn dev` or `yarn start` to get started

## Production

production currently uses `pm2` for this template, which is not installed in
this package, because it should be installed globally.
